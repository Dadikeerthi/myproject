====================
async
-----

javascript is a synchronous single threaded programming language
synchronous-is there any error in line 4 it not goes to line 5
* any function that takes time to run is asynchronous function//

16-08
-every asynchronous function will return promise
-a promise is an object to describe an eventual(future) completion of an asynchronous operation
- timers ae the basic asynchronous function.
let a=20;
setTimeout(function()
{
    consle.log("hai")
},1)
for (let i=0;i<1000;i++)
{
    console.log("hello world")
}

API- application programming interface

-using someones data 
-backend connected to database will create an api end point that consists data in xml/json format
-java connect to database , html,css not connected to database
https://api.quotable.io/random , in this url /random is endpoint and 
//h/w:-https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke

link:css  -> for linking style

1.set
-add
-delete
-clear
-has

2.map-udes to store or manipulate unique key values
-set is used to set key and values-get is used to get value based on akey
-delete is used to delete the value

3.date
-date is used to store or get the curent date/time/any related data
-new object created from date class can be used to get or set date related values
4.regex
-used to select/create/test regular expressions for a specific patterns
-test()-used for testing certain regular expression matches or not
-match()-used to retrieve first matched regular expressions

===================
-your whole js engine is maintained by one object -- window
-wndow maintains gobal execution content
-window contains document,fetch,console,timers,location,geolocation,navigator,etc.
-understading about browser object is known as Browser Object Model(BOM).

/any geo location
window.navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((pos)=>console.log(pos.coords))

/window locaton-- used to manipulate current url
/window.navigator.mediaDevices.getUsermedia({video:true}).then(S=>)

/memory storage
-browsers can store the data
1.local stoarge--it stores the data in the browser perminantly(perminant memory)
2.session storage--it stores the data in browser but the moment browser closed, data will be erased(temporary memory)

what is cache?
-temporary memory for fast retrieval.
what is session?
-session is a duration used for autherization token.

========
Libraries
-library is nothing but predefned code used for specific purpose.
eg: reactjs is a library for UI purposes.
framewok-framework is nothing but a complete package for a project
eg: angular is a framework

popular js libraries are
-jquery
-react
-axios
-GSAP
-three js, etc..


---libraries

jquery-dom manipulation
typedjs-typing effect
aos(animate on screen)
slickjs-gives sliders
own carousel-sliding effect
tns sliders-sliding effect
swiper js-sliding effect
anime js, GSAP , three js--
google like cv
terminal portfolio
potfolio like reel,whsp chat

js basics
===========
ntroduction
diff blw let var const
js engines,execution content,hoisting
data types(prm ,non prm)
prm - numbers,methods,math methods,strings,boolean,undfined,nul
nonprm- functions,arrow function expression,call back,closure,arays,objects
cntrl stsmts- if switch
events, dom
asyns-
timers(setinterval,set timeout )
fetch
promises, promise chaining
async await
es6-template literals,arrow,rest vs spread, destructuring modules, classes, and object, inheritance
advanced data types
BOM
